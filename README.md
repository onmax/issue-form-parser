# Issue Form Parser - GitHub Action

Convert GitHub Form Issues into JSON objects with this simple Action.

![Issue Form Parser](./issue-form-parser.png)

---

## Description

This GitHub Action allows you to easily convert GitHub issues into JSON objects,
making it simple to work with and manipulate issue data in your workflow. With
just a few simple steps, you can use this action to automatically convert an
issue into a JSON object, which can then be used for a variety of purposes, such
as data analysis, reporting, or integration with other systems. This action is
designed to be flexible and easy to use, so you can quickly and easily convert
issues into JSON format without any hassle.

## Parameters

| Name           | Required | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `issue_number` | `true`   | The issue number to parse.                                                                                |
| `github_token` | `false`  | The GitHub token to use for authentication and fetching the issue. Defaults to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. |

## Usage

First, you need to create a GitHub Issue Form. You can read more about it
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms).

Then, you need to create a workflow file and include the following step:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Parse issue
    id: parse
    uses: onmax/issue-form-parser@v1.6.0
    with:
      issue_number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}

  # Examples on how to use the output
  - name: Show parsed payload data
    run: |
      # Using the character `'` to prevent all characters enclosed within
      # them from being treated as special characters (e.g. $ or `)
      echo '${{ steps.parse.outputs.payload }}'

      # Print the value of the "Name" field
      echo '${{ fromJson(steps.parse.outputs.payload)["Name"] }}'
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The action only works with issues, not pull requests.
- **The `issue_number` input is required.** If the event that trigger the
  workflow is not an issue, you need to specify the issue number manually.
- **The returned `payload` is a string.** You need to use `fromJson` to convert
  it to a JSON object. Read more about
  [GitHub Actions expressions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#fromJson).

## Example

This issue:

```md
### Country

Spain

### Age

The age of the candidate is 17 years old

### Languages

Python, TypeScript, others...

### How many years of experience do you have?

I have 2 years of experience

### What languages do you know?

- [x] Python
- [x] TypeScript
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] C++
```

Will be converted to:

```json
{
  "Country": "Spain",
  "Age": "The age of the candidate is 17 years old",
  "Languages": ["Python", "TypeScript", "others..."],
  "How many years of experience do you have?": "I have 2 years of experience",
  "What languages do you know?": {
    "Python": true,
    "TypeScript": true,
    "JavaScript": false,
    "C++": false
  }
}
```

### üìù Notes

- If you use Dropdowns with multiple answers, the answers will be an array. This
  is also true for answers that are separated by commas.
- If you use Checkboxes, the answers will be an object with the name of the
  checkbox as the key and the value will be `true` if the checkbox is checked,
  and `false` if it is not.

## Types of issues

To understand and format the issues, first we need to understand the different
types of issues that can be created using GitHub UI. There are two types of
issues that can be created:

### Issue Form

This types of forms are created using the issue form feature, where the user
needs to fill in the form. The content of the issue is the form itself, and the
user's answers are in the body of the issue.

```md
### Question 1\n\nAnswer 1\n\n### Question 2\n\nAnswer 2\n\n### Question 3\n\nAnswer 3
```

This issue will be parsed as:

```json
{
  "Question 1": "Answer 1",
  "Question 2": "Answer 2",
  "Question 3": "Answer 3"
}
```

### Regular issue

This types of forms are the more traditional ones, where the user can write
whatever they want in the body of the issue. The content of the issue is the
body of the issue.

```md
# Question 1\r\n\r\nThis is my answer\r\n\r\n## Question 2\r\n\r\nThis is my second answer\r\n\r\n#### Question 3\r\n\r\nThis is my third answer
```

This issue will be parsed as:

```json
{
  "Question 1": "This is my answer",
  "Question 2": "This is my second answer",
  "Question 3": "This is my third answer"
}
```

> As you can see, Regular issues required to have a title followed by a block
> with the answer.

You can see the two types of issues here:

- [Regular issue](https://api.github.com/repos/onmax/issue-form-parser/issues/10)

<summary>Special inputs</summary>

## Types of inputs

Apart from the `input` and `textarea` inputs, there are other types of inputs
that can be used in GitHub forms:

### Dropdown

With the dropdown input, the user can select one or more options from a list. In
the markdown, the options are separated by commas.

```md
### Languages\n\nSpanish, English, German
```

This issue will be parsed as:

```json
{
  "Languages": ["Spanish", "English", "German"]
}
```

### Checkboxes

With the checkboxes input, the user can select one or more options from a list.
In the markdown, the options are separated by commas.

```md
### Languages\n\n- [X] Spanish\n- [ ] English\n- [X] German
```

This issue will be parsed as:

```json
{
  "Languages": {
    "Spanish": true,
    "English": false,
    "German": true
  }
}
```
